# DukePerson Bluetooth Manager

### Overview

This is a simple iOS app, coded in Swift 4 using Xcode 9, that demonstrates functionality for a basic iPhone mobile application.

Through the app, users can view and store information about people associated with Duke University. The app supports storing multiple data fields, data persistance through Firebase, data transfer via Bluetooth, searching, image loading/saving, and animation with images and vector graphics.

I built this app as part of a group homework assignment in ECE 564, a class focusing on mobile development with iOS. The core application was built by another student ([this repo](https://github.com/robertsteilberg/DukePerson-manager) contains the version that I built from the ground up), but I implemented all functionality for sending and receiving records over Bluetooth.
